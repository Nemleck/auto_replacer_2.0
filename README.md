# Auto Replacer

- This program will **help you writing texts**, **do maths**, **search on wiki**, etc...
- To make this work, you'll just have to **start the `start.bat` file**.
- You can also create your own configurations. To make this, you may want to **edit the `keys.json` file**.
*(If there's no `keys.json` file, just launch the script once)*
